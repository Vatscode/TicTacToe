# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java. Two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, with automatic win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.

## Features
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Real-time board display after each move
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash/Terminal
   git clone [https://github.com/Vatscode/TicTacToe]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash/Terminal
   cd [project directory]
   ```
3. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash/Terminal
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash/Terminal

   ```

## Gameplay
- Players take turns entering the row and column (0, 1, or 2) to place their mark.
- The game ends when a player wins or all cells are filled.
- Invalid moves (choosing an already marked cell) prompt a retry.
